In our project, we aimed to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. We used the data from Western Penn. Regional Data Center and we analyzed and got the result from three metrics: crime rate, transportation conveniences, and the variety in housing prices. Through data analysis and visualization, we found that Squirrel Hill will be the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
